        We have to follow the law and offer you a classic "legal notice", the
        least read page in the entire history of the Internet. Surely no living
        being would ever willingly read a legal notice but, seeing as you're
        here, intentionally or by accident, we'll try to give you a pleasant
        read and, above all, try to help you understand (almost) everything we
        tell you, after we've run it by our interpreter for humans who arenâ€™t
        lawyers.
